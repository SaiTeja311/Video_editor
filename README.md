Video EditPro - Web-Based Video Editor Platform

Video EditPro is a front-end prototype for a simple, web-based video editing application. It features a modern, dark-themed user interface with a landing page, a login form, and a core feature that allows users to upload and preview a video file directly in the browser.

✨ Features

Modern Landing Page: A visually appealing homepage (index.html) that introduces the platform and its features.
User Login: A separate, styled login page (login.html) that simulates user authentication and redirects to the main application.
Video Upload: Users can click the "Upload Video" button to select a video file from their local machine.
In-Browser Video Preview: The selected video is loaded into a video player on the page, ready for playback.
Responsive Elements: The layout is designed to be functional and look good on different screen sizes.
Placeholder Editing Tools: The UI includes buttons for future editing functionalities like 'Trim', 'Cut', and 'Apply Effects'.

📂 File Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

├── index.html          # The main landing page and video editor interface.
├── login.html          # The user login page.
├── styles.css          # Main stylesheet for index.html.
├── login.css           # Stylesheet for the login page.
├── script.js           # (Currently minimal) JavaScript file. Core logic is in inline scripts.
└── Recording.mp4       # A sample video file for testing the upload feature.



🚀 How to Run the Project

This is a static front-end project and does not require a server to run.
Download the files: Make sure all the files (index.html, login.html, styles.css, login.css, etc.) are in the same directory.
Open in Browser:
Open the login.html file in your preferred web browser to start from the login screen.
Alternatively, open index.html directly to view the main application.

User Flow

Navigate to login.html.
Enter any text in the email and password fields and click the Login button. You will be redirected to index.html.
On the main page, click the Upload Video button.
Select a video file (e.g., the included Recording.mp4) from your computer.
The video will appear in the "Preview" section, where you can play it using the video controls.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling, layout, and animations. Key features used include:
Flexbox for component alignment.
Linear gradients for backgrounds and buttons.
Transitions for smooth hover effects.
JavaScript: For handling DOM events, such as button clicks and file uploads.

🔮 Future Improvements

This prototype lays the groundwork for several potential enhancements:
Implement Editing Tools: Add functionality to the "Trim," "Cut," and "Apply Effects" buttons.
Backend Integration: Develop a backend to handle user accounts (sign-up and authentication) and video processing.
Timeline Feature: Create a video timeline for more precise editing control.
Dynamic Effects: Allow users to add text overlays, filters, and transitions to their videos.
